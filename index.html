    <h1>Mediterranean Cuisine</h1>
    <p>
      The Mediterranean region has a rich culinary tradition that is influenced
      by the geography, history, and culture of the area. The countries
      surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, including Italy, Greece, Spain, and
      Morocco, have developed their own unique styles of cooking. However, they
      all share common ingredients and flavors, such as olive oil, herbs, and
      spices. The Mediterranean diet is known for its health benefits, including
      a lower risk of heart disease, certain types of cancer, and obesity. The
      diet is characterized by a high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole
      grains, and healthy fats, as well as a moderate intake of fish and
      poultry, and a low intake of red meat and processed foods.
